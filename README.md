# Stasis Theory Machine

Hello thinker! 

Think about stasis theory in terms of space and positionality. The goal of stasis is a kind of stopping...but more in the sense of hitting the "pause" button...we're actually readying ourselves and others to change our velocity (moving in a new direction and perhaps at a different speed in relation to others.) 
    
## Get Started


1. Create a GitHub account. 

2. Go to the the Elevator Pitch repository: [HERE](https://github.com/Pitt-Fuego/stasis-theory-machine)

3. Click "Code": Download ZIP to local computer. 

4. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and where you will organize your other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

5. Download and/or open a text editor like [brackets.io](https://brackets.io), [atom.io](https://atom.io), or [notepad-plus-plus.org](notepad-plus-plus.org). 

6. Use the text editor to open the style.css and index.html documents from your project folder.  

7. Start by reading the index.html in text editor where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text!

8. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, return to your GitHub page and create a new repository. Click  upload (push) your files. Upload, then hit "Commit!" 

9. Go to repository settings, scroll down to Github pages, change setting from "none" to "main."  

10. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

11. Test the URL. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
